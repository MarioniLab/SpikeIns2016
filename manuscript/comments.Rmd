# Explaining the simulation results

Variance ranking should largely be robust to spike-in variability.
Any variability should affect all genes equally, such that the ranking shouldn't change much.
Testing for significance over tehnical noise will be more sensitive, as the technical estimates are normalized by assuming no variability.
Any variability is absorbed into the total variability, resulting in an overestimate of the biological variability.
The extent to which this affects things will depend on the magnitude of the variability.

For DE analyses, the ranking should also be robust, provided that sufficient cells are present in each condition.
Any variability will average out across the condition, such that the log-fold change between conditions is unaffected.
Of course, the variance of each gene will be increased by the same amount.
This won't affect the rankings, as each gene will be affected; however, it will result in loss of power.
Whether this results in a substantial effect in detection depends on the size of the increase.

Clustering is likely to be most sensitive to spike-in variability.
This is because clustering (and dimension reduction) treats each cell as its own entity.
Fluctuations in spike-in quantities will affect the quantification and inferences for that cell.
There is no averaging out that can robustify against changes at a per-cell level.
